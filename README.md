# NodeJS-Websocket-SPA
An experimental single page application using websocket.

A responsive SPA using only HTML, CSS, Javascript or JQuery in the front-end.

As usual we will evaluate it using CRUD operations in the back-end connecting to SQL Express server
using Entity Framework Code-First Approach and a NodeJS MongoDB.

Without REST API to map our CRUD operations to any HTTP methods,
we will move our data from the front-end to our endpoints in the back-end
using a simple header and payload JSON data packet.
Packet communication is prevalent in the lower phyical layer in any
computer networking among them is the internet.

# NodeJS-Websocket-SPA
A single page application using websocket.

Using only jQuery in the frontend, we can create a very responsive SPA.

We can easily connect to any NoSQL or SQL database for our data storage.

Here, we will use MongoDB for simple CRUD operations.

We will move our data back and forth from our server to client using a simple header and payload JSON data packets.

After parsing the JSON header properties, we can easily route it to any corresponding CRUD data operation functions or any other custom functions for whatever applications you have in the backend.

Or just tunnel it to any console applications you have in C++, C or C# and of course to any other NodeJS applications.

We will use https and use helmet to enforce security measures to our websocket app in Express web framework.

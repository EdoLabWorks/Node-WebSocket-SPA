# NodeJS-Websocket-SPA
An experimental single page application using websocket.

A responsive SPA using only HTML, CSS, Javascript or JQuery in the front-end.

As usual we will evaluate it using CRUD operations connecting to SQL Express Server
using Entity Framework Code-First Approach and a NodeJS MongoDB.

Without a REST API to map our CRUD operations with HTTP methods,
we will move our data back and forth using a simple header and payload JSON data packets
between our front-end and back-end services.

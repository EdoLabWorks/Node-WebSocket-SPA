# NodeJS-Websocket-SPA
An experimental single page application using websocket.

We will evaluate its performance using CRUD operations connecting to SQL Express Server
using Entity Framework and a NodeJS MongoDB database.

Without a REST API to map our CRUD operations using HTTP methods,
we will move our data back and forth between our front-end and back-end services using a simple header and payload JSON data packets.

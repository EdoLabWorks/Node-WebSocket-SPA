# NodeJS-Websocket-SPA
An experimental single page application using websocket.

A responsive SPA using only HTML, CSS, Javascript or JQuery in the front-end.

As usual we will evaluate it using CRUD operations connecting to SQL Express Server
using Entity Framework and a NodeJS MongoDB database.

Without a REST API to map our CRUD operations using HTTP methods,
we will move our data back and forth between our front-end and back-end services using a simple header and payload JSON data packets.
